  <h2>About Mercy</h2> <!-- heading 2-->
  
<p> Where do I start? I spent years as a laboratory associate and enjoy working with a team. I've always been facinated with html and css since the early days of MySpace. During my time as a research associate, I had some exposure to python which was equally interesting. While researching the different fields in tech, I found that software engineering was the suitable choice.</p>
<p>With acquring new skills, I strive to create more interactive applications to improve user experience. Most importantly, I'm excited to join a community of individuals with similar goals. I look forward to collaborating with other engineers and IT professionals to solve problems and come up with innovative solutions for our users. During my free time, I either find myself catching up on sleep, hanging out at the mall, or putting in some work at the gym. </p>
